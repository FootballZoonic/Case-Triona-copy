      This project involves the development of an application that consumes log files from one of Trionaâ€™s cloud-based
      software products (C-load).
      The purpose of the application is to analyze and visualize usage patterns based on the information contained in
      the log files.
      The application should be able to identify which parts of the software product are being used and the extent to
      which they are utilized.
      This analysis will provide a deeper understanding of user behavior and enable the optimization of the software
      product based on these insights.
